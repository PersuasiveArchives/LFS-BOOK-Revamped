      <p>
        My journey into learning and understanding Linux began back in 1998 when I installed my first Linux distribution. I was immediately captivated by the concept and philosophy behind it, and I quickly found myself intrigued by the possibilities it offered.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        There are always multiple ways to achieve a single goal, and the same is true for Linux distributions. Over the years, many different distributions have appeared—some are still around, some have evolved into new forms, and others have faded into memory. Each distribution serves its audience in a unique way, tailoring its approach to meet specific needs. With so many different ways to accomplish the same objective, I began to realize that I no longer had to be confined to a single implementation. Before discovering Linux, we were simply resigned to the limitations of other operating systems. You had no choice but to accept the issues they came with. But with Linux, the concept of choice emerged. If something didn’t work for you, you had the freedom—and the encouragement—to change it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I experimented with several different distributions but found it hard to settle on just one. Each system had its own strengths, and it wasn’t about right or wrong anymore—it was about what best suited my preferences. With so much variety available, it became clear that no single system would be perfect for me. So, I decided to create my own Linux system, one that would align with my personal tastes and needs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        To truly make it my own, I committed to compiling everything from source code, rather than using precompiled binary packages. This “<span class="quote">perfect</span>” Linux system would incorporate the best features from various systems, while avoiding their limitations. At first, the idea seemed daunting, but I was determined to make it work.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        After overcoming challenges like circular dependencies and compile-time errors, I finally succeeded in building a custom Linux system. It was fully operational and functional, just like any of the other Linux systems at the time. But this system was different—it was my creation. It was incredibly satisfying to have built something from scratch. The only thing that could have made it even better would have been creating each piece of software myself. But, this came pretty close.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As I shared my goals and experiences with others in the Linux community, it became clear that many people were interested in this approach. Not only did these custom-built systems help meet specific needs, but they also offered a valuable learning opportunity for programmers and system administrators to enhance their Linux skills. This growing interest led to the creation of the <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux From Scratch Project</em></span>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The <em>Linux From Scratch</em> book is the central resource for that project. It provides the background information and step-by-step instructions needed to design and build your own system. While the book offers a template that results in a fully functional system, you’re encouraged to customize the instructions to suit your specific needs. After all, this project is about you being in control, with just a little guidance to help you get started on your journey.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I sincerely hope you enjoy working on your own Linux From Scratch system and that you appreciate the many benefits of having a system that’s truly your own.
