![Alt text](tuxhd.png "LFS-REVAMPED LOGO")

This project gives you step-by-step instructions for building your own Linux system from scratch.
With the new edition of Linux From Scratch, we want to make it easier for you to build a custom Linux system from the beginning.
This updated version has a better CSS structure that makes the documentation and guides look cleaner and more modern.
The user interface is more intuitive and attractive, so it's easier to use for everyone.
